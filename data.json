        "default_text": "The In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) portfolio provides a solution towards sustainable, flexible missions through on-demand fabrication, replacement, and recycling capabilities to support critical systems, habitats, and mission logistics and maintenance. These capabilities can provide tangible cost savings by reducing launch mass and volume; reducing risk by decreasing dependence on spares; reducing over-designing systems for reliability instead of maintainability; enabling the fabrication of large structures; and enabling crew to respond to unanticipated scenarios. ISM is developing these capabilities by leveraging new technologies being developed terrestrially and adapting them for operations in environments with varied pressure, gravity, temperature, and radiation. The International Space Station (ISS) serves as a one-of-a-kind microgravity test bed on the ISM technology development roadmap. The current ISS logistics model is heavily dependent upon Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) for system-based (vs. component level) repair and maintenance. ISM provides an approach which will help to enable sustainable, affordable mission operations and logistics. Additionally, ISM is key to addressing significant logistics challenges for long-duration missions by reducing launch and spares mass, providing flexible risk coverage, and enabling new capabilities that are required for sustainable Exploration missions. Potential ISM applications include free-flying and EVA missions. Large-scale structure fabrication will need to be performed outside a controlled environment in LEO or on the Moon or Mars and the ISM project is well-positioned to enable those activities. The current ISM portfolio includes two projects: On-Demand Multi-material Manufacturing (ODMM), currently funded by both ESDMD/MCO and STMD/GCD; and On-Demand Manufacturing of Electronics (ODME), funded by STMD. Recycling/reuse and outfitting are additional areas of interest but are not currently funded. The ODMM project is pursuing the development of a multi-material Fabrication Laboratory, or FabLab, from Techshot, Inc., a subsidiary of Redwire, Inc. FabLab uses bound metal additive manufacturing to extrude a polymer/metal feedstock blend to produce a &#34;green&#34; (low-density) part. The green part is then transferred into a furnace, where the polymer constituents are removed, and the remaining metal is consolidated. FabLab has the potential to expand the material processing capability to multiple metals as well as polymers and electronics, with the vision of providing an adaptable capability for future missions. This adaptable capability enables long duration missions through substantial risk reduction based on the ability to fabricate parts for unforeseeable needs. ODME is developing on-demand manufacturing of a wide range of electronics, sensors, and power &amp; energy devices for manufacturing in microgravity on the ISS and on the lunar surface to support Artemis surface construction and exploration activities. The project is developing the next generation of deposition systems for printing precise patterns of electronics in microgravity and extreme environments. ODME is also developing materials and sensors to support self-powered sensor networks and replacement electronics for Logistics Reduction. It should be noted that FabLab is a key component of ODME â€“ the advanced toolplate in the print module is capable of the very fine printing of circuit boards and other electronic components. ISM is currently seeking opportunities to send up FabLab without the furnace module initially (to demo ODME processes) and then later send up the furnace module for ODMM development. ODME is also leading the NASA Commercialization initiative for manufacturing semiconductors in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). ODME is developing next-generation materials, processes, and device designs to take maximum advantage of microgravity for semiconductor manufacturing to offer significant competitive advantages over terrestrial semiconductor manufacturing. The enabling of these new semiconductor technologies by ODME will also advance NASA&#39;s capability to manufacture next-generation electronics in space for exploration missions and lunar applications.",
        "ai_text": "<h1>Building in Space: NASA\u2019s Plan to Make Space Exploration Smarter and More Sustainable</h1>\n<p>What if astronauts could build the tools and parts they need right in space, instead of waiting for resupply missions from Earth? That\u2019s exactly what NASA\u2019s In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) program is working to achieve. By creating new ways to make, fix, and recycle essential items during missions, ISM is shaping the future of space exploration\u2014making it safer, more flexible, and less expensive.</p>\n<h2>Why Make Things in Space?</h2>\n<p>Getting supplies into space is a costly challenge. Every tool and spare part must be launched from Earth, adding weight, space, and expense to missions. ISM offers a smarter solution: manufacture items in space as needed.</p>\n<p>This approach has major benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Save Costs:</strong> Fewer spare parts mean less weight and space on rockets.</li>\n    <li><strong>Handle Surprises:</strong> If something breaks, astronauts can create a solution on the spot.</li>\n    <li><strong>Build Bigger:</strong> It\u2019s easier to make large structures in space than to launch them from Earth.</li>\n    <li><strong>Prepare for Long Missions:</strong> For trips to the Moon or Mars, ISM reduces dependence on Earth-based resupply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Testing on the ISS</h2>\n<p>The International Space Station (ISS) is helping NASA test this game-changing technology. Traditionally, the ISS relies on pre-made spare parts from Earth for repairs. ISM is testing ways to produce those parts directly on the station, paving the way for more self-sufficient missions.</p>\n<h2>Key ISM Projects</h2>\n<p>NASA is focusing on two exciting projects:</p>\n<h3>FabLab: A Space Workshop</h3>\n<p>The FabLab is a tool that can create parts using different materials like metal and plastic. Astronauts could use it to make tools or repair parts on demand, instead of waiting for replacements from Earth.</p>\n<h3>Space Electronics</h3>\n<p>Another project focuses on making electronics, like sensors and circuit boards, right in space. This could be especially useful for future Moon missions, where astronauts need to build or repair high-tech equipment quickly.</p>\n<h2>The Future of Space Exploration</h2>\n<p>In-space manufacturing isn\u2019t just about convenience\u2014it\u2019s about making exploration sustainable. Imagine astronauts building habitats on Mars or repairing equipment with tools they\u2019ve just made. These technologies could also open up opportunities for businesses to produce unique materials in space, benefiting industries back on Earth.</p>\n<p>By developing these innovations, NASA is turning challenges into opportunities, bringing us closer to a future where humans can live and work in space like never before.</p>"

        "ai_text": "<p>NASA and Pepin Associates are working on a new technology to create stronger, lightweight materials that can handle extreme heat. These materials could be used to build complex parts of spacecraft, like the ones that protect them from the intense heat of re-entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere.</p> <p>The challenge is that building heat-resistant materials with complex shapes is usually expensive and time-consuming. Pepin Associates has found a way to make this process faster and more affordable using a method that combines strong, lightweight materials into pre-formed shapes. These shapes are easier to produce while still being tough enough to handle extreme temperatures and stress.</p> <p>To test this new method, Pepin Associates created sample panels and compared their strength to traditional materials. The team performed tests at both room temperature and high heat to ensure the new material could hold up under pressure. They also successfully built a small part of a spacecraft skin to show how the material works in real applications.</p> <p>This breakthrough could lead to the creation of affordable, heat-resistant parts for future spacecraft, helping NASA continue to design innovative solutions for space exploration.</p>"

But what if a spacecraft\u2019s body itself could handle the heat? That\u2019s where <em>\u201chot structure\u201d</em> systems come in. These advanced materials serve two jobs: acting as both the spacecraft\u2019s structure and its heat shield, eliminating the need for separate protection layers.</p> <h2>Super Strong, Super Lightweight: The Solution</h2> <p>To tackle this, Sporian Microsystems is developing a new kind of material: <strong>polymer-derived ceramics</strong>. These materials are not only lightweight but can also handle temperatures between <strong>1000&deg;C and 2200&deg;C</strong>&mdash;hot enough to survive re-entry into a planet\u2019s atmosphere.</p> <p>Sporian\u2019s focus is on a ceramic material called <strong>silicon carbonitride (SiCN)</strong>. This cutting-edge material balances two critical needs:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Strength</strong>: It must hold up under extreme mechanical loads.</li> <li><strong>Heat Resistance</strong>: It has to protect the spacecraft from intense heat and temperature swings.</li> </ul> <h2>Building the Future of Spacecraft</h2> <p>Sporian is combining this innovative material with <strong>3D printing</strong> techniques to create complex, lightweight components.

        "default_text": "The value of laser altimetry data for mapping the surface of the Earth and other planetary bodies is well established, and the data provided on Earthâ€™s forests and monitoring long term changes in ice sheets has had a profound impact on our understanding of the impacts of Earthâ€™s changing climate.  Previous sensors (GEDI/ ATLAS/ICESat-2, ICESat, SLA, MOLA, LOLA, MLA) do this using only a small number of beams and sample, at most, just a few % of the surface. Swath mapping technologies are essential to fully realize the potential of laser altimetry for mapping and precisely monitoring the dynamics of the Earth and other planetary surfaces. We propose to build a test a prototype of a solid-state, no moving parts, highly efficient, fast, reliable, and accurate scanner, that generates 10-100 select-able beam positions from a single laser to provide 1-2 orders of magnitude increase in mapping coverage. Successful demonstration of a solid-state laser scanner that can generate more than an order of magnitude increase in coverage from a single laser is an enabling step for future imaging lidar opportunities called for in the Surface Topography & Vegetation (STV) program.  Wide area mapping of surface topography and structure, including vegetation/forests, and monitoring changes are critical for monitoring the impacts of a changing climate.  There are numerous science and operations applications that can benefit from precise surface mapping and change detection.",
        "ai_text": "<h2>Mapping Earth's Surface and Beyond</h2><p>Laser altimetry is a powerful tool used to map the surface of Earth and other planets. It's helped scientists understand important things like changes in Earth's forests and ice sheets, which is essential for studying climate change. However, the sensors weâ€™ve used so far only sample a small part of the surfaceâ€”often just a few percent. To get a better, more complete picture, we need technology that can map larger areas quickly and accurately.</p><h2>The Need for More Coverage</h2><p>To make the most of laser altimetry, we need a technology that can cover much larger areas in a short time. This is where swath mapping technology comes in. It allows us to gather data from much bigger sections of land or space in a single scan, making it possible to monitor changes in surface topography (like the shape of the land), vegetation (like forests), and other features more effectively.</p><h2>Introducing a New Laser Scanner</h2><p>A new solid-state laser scanner could be the game-changer we need. This scanner has no moving parts, making it faster, more reliable, and more accurate than older models. It can shoot out 10 to 100 beams from just one laser, which means it can cover up to 100 times more area than current laser systems. This will allow scientists to gather much more data in less time.</p><h2>Why This Is Important</h2><p>With this new laser scanner, we can map wide areas more quickly and accurately, which is especially important for NASAâ€™s Surface Topography & Vegetation program. This program is focused on monitoring the Earthâ€™s surface, including forests, ice sheets, and other features. The more data we can collect, the better we can understand how the Earthâ€™s climate is changing and how it might change in the future.</p><h2>Helping Climate Science</h2><p>This new technology has huge potential for climate science. It will make it easier to track changes in the environment, like shifts in forests and ice caps. With more accurate maps, scientists can better understand how our planet is changing and what we can do about it.</p><h2>A Bright Future for Mapping Technology</h2><p>By enabling faster, more precise surface mapping, this new laser scanner will open up exciting new possibilities for exploring Earth and other planets. It will help scientists keep track of changes over time, giving us a clearer understanding of how our world is evolving.</p>"
