        "default_text": "This project aims to aggressively reduce the size of the Power System Electronics (PSE), low-voltage telemetry, and housekeeping (HK) electronics. The goal is to combine multiple discrete analog, digital, and mixed-signal devices into a single smart, radiation hardened, system-on-a-chip (SOC) chip solution. Ultimately this effort seeks to produce a flight worthy rad-hard device that will replace several discrete components in current and future PSE designs thus reducing the size, mass, power, complexity, and cost. At a higher level the device will serve as a modular low-power data acquisition SOC, suitable for miniaturized instruments and spacecraft smart/automated housekeeping data collection. The main benefits are the reduction of size, mass, and power over current state-of-the-art and the next generation of PSE cards. The proposed device will not only support current and future GSFC PSE architectures, but it will also benefits CubeSat instruments, CubeSat PSE designs, and PSE designs for lunar surface, planetary, and heliophysics payloads.",

        "default_text": "The In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) portfolio provides a solution towards sustainable, flexible missions through on-demand fabrication, replacement, and recycling capabilities to support critical systems, habitats, and mission logistics and maintenance. These capabilities can provide tangible cost savings by reducing launch mass and volume; reducing risk by decreasing dependence on spares; reducing over-designing systems for reliability instead of maintainability; enabling the fabrication of large structures; and enabling crew to respond to unanticipated scenarios. ISM is developing these capabilities by leveraging new technologies being developed terrestrially and adapting them for operations in environments with varied pressure, gravity, temperature, and radiation. The International Space Station (ISS) serves as a one-of-a-kind microgravity test bed on the ISM technology development roadmap. The current ISS logistics model is heavily dependent upon Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) for system-based (vs. component level) repair and maintenance. ISM provides an approach which will help to enable sustainable, affordable mission operations and logistics. Additionally, ISM is key to addressing significant logistics challenges for long-duration missions by reducing launch and spares mass, providing flexible risk coverage, and enabling new capabilities that are required for sustainable Exploration missions. Potential ISM applications include free-flying and EVA missions. Large-scale structure fabrication will need to be performed outside a controlled environment in LEO or on the Moon or Mars and the ISM project is well-positioned to enable those activities. The current ISM portfolio includes two projects: On-Demand Multi-material Manufacturing (ODMM), currently funded by both ESDMD/MCO and STMD/GCD; and On-Demand Manufacturing of Electronics (ODME), funded by STMD. Recycling/reuse and outfitting are additional areas of interest but are not currently funded. The ODMM project is pursuing the development of a multi-material Fabrication Laboratory, or FabLab, from Techshot, Inc., a subsidiary of Redwire, Inc. FabLab uses bound metal additive manufacturing to extrude a polymer/metal feedstock blend to produce a &#34;green&#34; (low-density) part. The green part is then transferred into a furnace, where the polymer constituents are removed, and the remaining metal is consolidated. FabLab has the potential to expand the material processing capability to multiple metals as well as polymers and electronics, with the vision of providing an adaptable capability for future missions. This adaptable capability enables long duration missions through substantial risk reduction based on the ability to fabricate parts for unforeseeable needs. ODME is developing on-demand manufacturing of a wide range of electronics, sensors, and power &amp; energy devices for manufacturing in microgravity on the ISS and on the lunar surface to support Artemis surface construction and exploration activities. The project is developing the next generation of deposition systems for printing precise patterns of electronics in microgravity and extreme environments. ODME is also developing materials and sensors to support self-powered sensor networks and replacement electronics for Logistics Reduction. It should be noted that FabLab is a key component of ODME – the advanced toolplate in the print module is capable of the very fine printing of circuit boards and other electronic components. ISM is currently seeking opportunities to send up FabLab without the furnace module initially (to demo ODME processes) and then later send up the furnace module for ODMM development. ODME is also leading the NASA Commercialization initiative for manufacturing semiconductors in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). ODME is developing next-generation materials, processes, and device designs to take maximum advantage of microgravity for semiconductor manufacturing to offer significant competitive advantages over terrestrial semiconductor manufacturing. The enabling of these new semiconductor technologies by ODME will also advance NASA&#39;s capability to manufacture next-generation electronics in space for exploration missions and lunar applications.",

Coupled with advanced CMC processing technologies these tailored formable preforms offer the potential for affordable hot structures of complex shape.

Tension, interlaminar shear, and in plane shear tests are performed at room temperature and elevated temperature. Pepin Associates further demonstrates the ability of the tailored formable preform to fabricate an integrated stiffened skin subcomponent. This subcomponent employs selective 3D reinforcement in a formable preform. Material inspections verify the quality of this precursor structure such that it could be further processed to yield a CMC integrated hot structure.

Hypersonic vehicles require sealing materials between individual body panels and components of the weapons structure and propulsion system, including around dynamic flaps and rudders. Current state-of-the-art high temperature thermal seals are often made from ceramic oxide fibers that are easily abraded at room temperature, even more so at sustained, elevated temperatures. An abraded seal can lead to higher leak rates, increased temperatures, and decreased life-span (increased cost). There is a need to improve the abrasion resistance of these seals without significantly reducing their other desirable characteristics (e.g., flexibility, temperature capability, flow-blocking). To that end, Jackson Bond Enterprises LLC (JBE) proposes the following in Phase I. First, JBE will partner with prime contractors and NASA stakeholders to research and identify potential abrasion resistant coatings and down-select the most promising coating types. JBE has already identified two potential coating types in this proposal. Second, JBE will manufacture coupons representative of high temperature seals and apply the chosen coatings. Third, JBE will utilize in-house capability to perform abrasion testing on the coupons to determine the effectiveness of the coatings vs. baseline state-of-the art seals. As a result of the work done in Phase I, one or more coatings will be identified, applied, tested for abrasion resistance, and either accepted or rejected for additional (Phase II) testing and development.",

        "default_text": "The development of robust and efficient Entry, Descent and Landing systems fulfill the critical function of delivering payloads to planetary surfaces through challenging environments. Future NASA missions will require new technologies to further space exploration and delivery of high mass loads. Of particular interest is the development of reusable hot structure technologies for primary structures exposed to extreme heating environments on atmospheric entry vehicles. A hot structure system is a multifunctional structure that can reduce/eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system. Thus, there is a need for the development of new technologies to support the realization of low-cost, reusable hot structures applicable to atmospheric entry vehicles. A key barrier is the requirement for the lightweight form to not only carry mechanical loads but also accommodate high temperatures (1000-2200°C), severe transient heating, and temperature gradients through the thickness. Novel materials and associated fabrication processes are needed to balance the demand for structural cohesiveness with desired thermal properties required to protect structure interiors.

The long-term objective of this proposed work is to heavily leverage Phase I efforts with prior preceramic precursor based insulating materials development, and revise processes that can be used to realize hot structure systems.
